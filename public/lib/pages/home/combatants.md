## Fierce Combatants

### GAME PIECES

Yet another familiar feature with a twist. Vie’s game pieces represent your **_Combatants_** and their mission is to lay siege to the enemy’s castle. A unit moves fairly slowly on its own, but at any point they are ripe to be **_embodied_** by a Combatant card. Then it gets interesting. While an unembodied Combatant moves at the slow pace of a typical pawn (i.e. Chess), once embodied by a card, the Combatant can become a fierce and unbridled entity.
